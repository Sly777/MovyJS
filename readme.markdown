# MovyJS #
## version 1.0.0 - 05.03.2013 ##

Users can control your website with their mouse move (or touch move) now! Use preset moves or create your move combo. This plugin works on **IE8+**, **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari** and also on **safari mobile** and **android mobile**.

## Usage ##

- include the latest version jquery in your page (min. jquery 1.7)
- include the latest version this plugin
- use .movyjs() to iframe that you want to fix

***Examples is in the /examples/ folder.***

## Options ##

- **pixelLimit**: This number is needed for pixel move size (default : 30)
- **moveType**: Use preset moves *(shake, triangle, square)* or custom move *(custom)* (default : "shake")
- **customMoveType**: If you use "custom" on movetype, it works. It's array variable so you must add move items *(left, right, top, bottom, topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright)* (default : [] )
- **onComplete** : It works when moves finished
- **onEveryTick** : It works every move finished
- **onAfterStart** : It works before first move.
